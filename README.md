## Parameters
Lens was made using anycubic transparent resin on anycubic photon mono 4. Its made of 60 lenticules on lenght of 57,20 mm. Each lenticule has sagitta of 0,29 mm and total height of 0,98 mm, radius of lens is 0,55 mm.
## Result
Image is blurry, but effect is visible showing that it is possible to create 3d image on phone with lens. Possible improvments include:
- Better quality resin (clearer lens without yellow tint)
- Improved postprocessing (to avoid bends)
- More accurate calculations for specific screens (thickness of glass + screen protector of phone used in experiment is unknown)
